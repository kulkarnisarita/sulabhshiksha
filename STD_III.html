		<br /> The Sun and rain in feacle weather<br />
		Were playing hide and seek together,<br />
		
	</p1>
	<p1>
		<br /> And each in turn would try to chase<br />
		The other from his hiding place.<br />
		
	</p1>
	<p1>
		<br /> At last they met to say,"Good Bye",.<br />
		And lo! A rainbow spanned the sky.<br />
